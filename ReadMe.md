To run the App:

Firstly, this app initializes the database with tables and some data in it and connects that database with the app so anyone can get the information through api.
This app supports all the methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.
The database has mainly 4 tables: student,teacher,class and student-class.
When you run the app, it creates the database with these tables and also stores some data at same time and when you close the app, the database gets deleted by itself.
